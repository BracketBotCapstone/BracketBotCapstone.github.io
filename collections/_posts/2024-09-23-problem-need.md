## Project Overview

This capstone project aims to develop a robot capable of navigating and interacting within both known and unknown flat environments. The robot will be able to interact with humans
for the purpose of navigation and other information retrievable tasks.

The project will explore alternative robot designs beyond humanoid forms, assess human-robot interaction in settings populated with multiple robots, and evaluate the efficacy of specialized, low-cost robots.

## Need

In a rapidly advancing technological landscape, the integration of robots into everyday environments is becoming increasingly essential. There is a growing need for robots that can efficiently navigate and assist in various tasks within both familiar and unfamiliar settings. 

### Specific Context: Shared Spaces

In environments such as universities, where the population density can vary significantly, robots can play a crucial role in enhancing the overall experience for students and faculty. The need for robots to navigate people and provide information in such shared spaces includes:

- **Guidance and Navigation**: With large campuses and numerous facilities, students often require assistance in finding their way. Robots that can accurately navigate through crowds and offer directions can greatly alleviate confusion and improve the flow of movement within the campus.

- **Information Dissemination**: Robots can serve as interactive information kiosks, providing real-time updates about events, class schedules, or campus news. This capability enhances communication and ensures that individuals have access to essential information without seeking out a human resource.

By exploring non-humanoid robot designs, we aim to broaden the understanding of robotic applications and enhance human interaction with robotic systems.

## Problem Definition

Currently, many robotic systems are designed in humanoid form, which may not always be the most efficient or practical solution for specific tasks. This project seeks to address the following problems:

1. **Limited Robot Form Factors**: The existing focus on humanoid and other robots restricts innovation and the exploration of more effective robot designs.
2. **Human Interaction**: As robots become more prevalent in shared spaces, understanding and improving human-robot interaction is crucial for acceptance and efficiency.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: There is a need for robots that are not only effective but also cost-efficient, making them accessible for various applications.

## Objectives

1. **Inspire Alternative Robot Designs**: Showcase the potential of specialized robots that serve specific purposes better than exsiting designs.
2. **Enhance Human-Robot Interaction**: Investigate and implement ways to improve how humans perceive and interact with multiple robots in their environment.
3. **Evaluate Low-Cost Solutions**: Assess the viability of cheaper, specialized robots as alternatives to traditional humanoid robots.

## Constraints

- **Low Cost Platform**: The robot must be built using affordable components to ensure accessibility for broader applications.
- **Customizability**: The design should allow for modifications and enhancements, enabling future improvements based on user feedback and technological advancements.
- **Robustness to New Software Additions**: The system must be designed to easily integrate new software updates and features without requiring extensive rework.
- **Flat Environment**: The robot will be tested primarily in flat environments, which presents unique challenges and opportunities for navigation and interaction.

## Criteria for Success

- **Navigation Accuracy**: The robot must effectively map and navigate both known and unknown flat environments.
- **User Interaction**: The robot should be able to interact with users in a meaningful way, providing guidance and responding to inquiries.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The overall cost of the robot should remain low while maintaining functionality and robustness.
- **Scalability**: The design should facilitate the addition of new features and capabilities over time.
