# Bill of Materials

The bill of materials for the robot is shown below:

The cost of the robot is approximately $250, which is below our initial budget of $500.

This BOM is quoted at a quantity of 50, which is likely ~25% lower at a quantity of 500.

A major cost to the BOM is the Raspberry Pi and the Intel Realsense camera, which is currently the most expensive component at $100 both.

We are working to try to replace the Raspberry Pi with cheaper robust solutions, and the camera with a lower cost stereo camera, upon which we can run open source depth estimation packages.
