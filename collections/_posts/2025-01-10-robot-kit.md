# Robot Kit

We have created the bracket bot into a low-cost open-source robotics dev kit.

Documentation for the assembly is available [here](https://docs.bracket.bot/docs/kit-assembly).

We have had people around campus come and try to assemble the robot.

## Flashing the SD Card

After assembly, we put together documentation to flash the raspberry pi with the latest operating system:

## Setting up the robot software

We have a script to set up the robot software: [OS Setup](https://github.com/BracketBotCapstone/quickstart/blob/integration/scripts/setup_os.sh)

And a script to setup and calibrate the motors: [Motor Setup](https://github.com/BracketBotCapstone/quickstart/blob/integration/scripts/motor_controller_setup.sh)

Then, the robot is ready to use!
